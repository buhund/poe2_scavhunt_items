Scavenger Hunt items for Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire

### What's this?

A simple way to enable the Scavenger Hunt items for Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire, without having to link together your Steam and Obsidian accounts.
This also makes the items available for those who purchased the game via e.g. [GOG](https://www.gog.com/).

*It should be noted that they can be made purchasable ingame via the Berath's Blessings achievement system.
To do so, spend 5 points on Unique Item Vendor. A merchant called the [Well-traveled Supplier](https://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Well-traveled_Supplier) will appear in Port Maje. This mearchant also sells other unique items.*


### How to

* Copy the file to `/Pillars of Eternity II/PillarsOfEternityII_Data/exported/design/gamedata/`
* The items will be added to your inventory when you load your game.
